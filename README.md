This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

A MERN-stack application, built using MongoDB, Express, React and Node, with Mongoose, to store books with their title, author, genre and isbn.

After facing challenges with regards to Mongod, I plan to refactor to connect to MongoDB Atlas instead - still using Mongoose
